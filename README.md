# Sorting-Visualizer-OPENGL
The aim of this project is to develop the computer graphics project in OpenGL to demonstrate the different sorting techniques.
User selects the sorting technique to be demonstrated. The sort is applied to a random array of numbers. Click on the reset button to randomize them. Then select any other sorting technique to demonstrate.
This project sorts a random set of numbers in ascending order displaying them graphically as bars with varying height.
Following sorting techniques are implemented:
Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion sort

An attempt has been made to develop an openGL which meets necessary requirements of the user successfully. Since it is user friendly it enables user to interact efficiently and easily. The development of mini project has given us a good exposure to openGL by which we have learnt some of the techniques which helps in the development of animation and gaming.
